# String-segmentation

given string is segmented and checked whether each segmented word is present in the dictionary of words or not. 
for the Naive approach time complexity has been found to be 2*pow(N)
from the tabulation approach time comlexity has been  found to be N**3

Approach	           Time complexity    	Space complexity
Recursive approach	 O(2**n)	            O(n)
Dynamic programming	 O(n**3)	            O(n)
