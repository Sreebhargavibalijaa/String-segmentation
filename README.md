# String-segmentation

given string is segmented and checked whether each segmented word is present in the dictionary of words or not. 
for the Naive approach time complexity has been found to be 2*pow(N)
from the tabulation approach time comlexity has been  found to be N**3

So, from recursive approach to dynamic programming, time complexity has significantly reduced. Through this we can conlude Dynamic programming technique will help to solve difficult problems in efficient way
